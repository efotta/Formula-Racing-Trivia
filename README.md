# Formula Racing Trivia - Complete Working Code

## âœ… What's This?

This is a **complete copy** of the working code from the Abacus.AI server 
(formula-trivia.abacusai.app). 

Your Vercel deployment is failing because your local GitHub repo has different 
code. This package will fix it.

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Start

See `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` for step-by-step guide.

## âœ¨ What's Included

- `app/` - All Next.js pages and API routes
- `components/` - All React components
- `lib/` - Database and utilities
- `prisma/` - Database schema
- `public/` - Static assets (icons, manifest)
- `scripts/` - Database seeding scripts
- All config files (tsconfig, next.config, etc.)

## ðŸŽ¯ After Setup

1. Your local project will match the working Abacus.AI server
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will deploy the correct code
4. Everything will work!
